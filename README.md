# Nick's PHP Blog
> Created by Nicholas Ramsay

This project uses PHP with an MVC pattern and is styled with Bootstrap.

Currently, there is no db connection, however there is a mock retrieval system for '$posts'. I have done work with databases in PHP and as a result I didn't feel the need to practice it.
        
This project uses proper routing (e.g. '/', '/posts', '/posts/1', ...) which I am not used to in PHP. Therefore, although simple, I am proud of this project, a lot has been learnt.
