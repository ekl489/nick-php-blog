    <h1>Welcome to my blog written in PHP!</h1>

    <p >
        This project uses PHP with an MVC pattern and is styled with Bootstrap.
        <br><br>
        I started this project with the intention of expanding my PHP knowledge from years ago by applying my back-end skills mostly from Node.js development(reason for MVC pattern).
        <br><br>
        Currently, there is no db connection, however there is a mock retrieval system for '$posts'.
        I have done work with databases in PHP and as a result I didn't feel the need to practice it.
        <br><br>
        This project uses proper routing (e.g. '/', '/posts', '/posts/1', ...) which I am not used to in PHP. Therefore, although simple, I am happy with the results of this project, a lot has been learnt.
        <br><br>
        Please feel free to explore the website.
